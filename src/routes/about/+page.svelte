		Engineering is tough and <span class="italic">great</span> engineering is without question a
		constant, hard-fought battle. Most of us have day jobs with taxing deadlines and demanding
		roadmaps that can sometimes leave us dry, monotonous & potentially questioning the big WHY AM I
		HERE. To balance out that energy, as engineers, creators, and most importantly problem solvers,
		we need to make time to

		Play induces a non-judgemental state of creation. Play is a catalyst for happy accidents. Play
		reminds us to have fun, and so many of us, need this reminder. Play is necessary for growth.
		Play is a central tenant of longetivity. And I'm looking to do this for a very long time.
