	<h1 class="text-3xl text-center font-bold pb-3">Mission</h1>

	<p class="p-3">
		My aim is for this to be a space the dev community can learn from, get inspired by and influence
		back.
	</p>

	<p class="p-3">
		Engineering is tough and <span class="italic">great</span> engineering is without question a
		constant, hard-fought battle. Most of us have day jobs with taxing deadlines and demanding
		roadmaps that can sometimes leave us dry, feeling monotonous & potentially questioning the big
		WHY AM I HERE. To balance out that energy, as engineers, creators, and most importantly problem
		solvers, we need to make time to
		<span class="italic">play</span>.
	</p>

	<p class="p-3">
		First and foremost, play reminds us to have fun, and so many of us need this reminder. But
		there's more. Play induces a non-judgemental state of creation. Play is a catalyst for happy
		accidents. Play is necessary for growth. Play is a central tenant of longevity.
	</p>

	<p class="p-3">And play is missing from our craft.</p>
