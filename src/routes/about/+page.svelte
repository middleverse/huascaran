	<h1 class="text-3xl text-center font-bold pb-3">Mission</h1>

	<p class="p-3">
		Engineering is tough and <span class="italic">great</span> engineering is without question a
		constant, hard-fought battle. Most of us have day jobs with taxing deadlines and demanding
		roadmaps that can sometimes have periods of feeling monotonous & potentially questioning the big
		WHY AM I HERE. To balance out that energy, as engineers, creators, and most importantly problem
		solvers, we need to make time to
		<span class="italic">play</span>.
	</p>

	<p class="p-3">And play is missing from our craft.</p>

	<p class="p-3">
		Play reminds us to have fun, and so many of us need this reminder. But there's more. Play
		induces a non-judgemental state of creation. Play is a catalyst for happy accidents. Play is
		necessary for growth. Play is a central tenant of longevity.
	</p>

	<p class="p-3">Let go of all the titles, expectations, bonuses & the chasing.</p>

	<p class="p-3">
		Let's cultivate an attitude of creating. Cool stuff, functional stuff, beautiful stuff, fast
		stuff, efficient stuff, unwanted stuff, over-engineered & under-engineered stuff. Tools, ui's,
		ai's, bots, servers, games, anything we can.
	</p>

	<p class="p-3">
		I believe, we can only understand ourselves when we're relaxed, while playing around and having
		fun.
	</p>
